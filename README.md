# Chatterbox

This program was inspired by the popular Netcat program. It's intended to serve the same basic purpose. Enter an IP, enter a port, and start a TCP connection. Send data back and forth.

I made this for mostly demonstrational purposes.

In the future as I learn more about programming and networking, I might do more with this like add UDP and the like.
